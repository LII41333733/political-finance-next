                <p>
                    Two months ago, I wrote an article entitled, The Coronavirus: Your Money or Your Life, discussing where
                    officials and capitalists were weighing and questioning
                    the severity of COVID-19 against the economic impact
                    of isolation. I used the same cartoon by James Albert
                    Wales because of the relevance of the battle that has
                    been waging for over 150 years in the United States,
                    but with a little variation. In the cartoon, Wales depicts
                    monopoly (organized capital) against socialism
                    (organized labor) with Puck seemingly pointing toward a
                    blindfolded Lady Liberty trying to maintain the scales of
                    justice.

                    In the 21<sup>st</sup>-century political economy the belligerents
                    may have changed a little. Monopoly is still organized
                    capital, maybe even more consolidated than in the
                    Gilded Age, but socialism, as it was named,
                    represented organized labor. Today, our “labor” force is
                    comprised more of administration, at the civil and
                    municipal levels, and less of production and labor as
                    many of those types of jobs have been exported since
                    the 1990s. Jack Bogle, of Vanguard, had once
                    summarized the evolution of the American economy as
                    Agrarian, Industrial, Service, and Paper. We might add
                    “Digital” or “Virtual” to that evolution. And so, our paper
                    or digital economy has taken an enormous hit with an
                    estimated 30 million newly unemployed, which brings
                    us to a revelation. Since the authorities at the state and
                    federal levels have mandated that only “essential”
                    businesses stay open and employees report, it begs the
                    question of what is considered essential and what is not.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If COVID-19 is as lethal and as contagious as advertised, then why are big-box stores like Home Depot, and
                    Walmart permitted to stay open to the public, even with so-called distancing in place? Why are we receiving
                    postal mail—most of it commercial junk mail? How safe are newspapers and those annoying flyers that are
                    thrown on the driveway every week? The inconsistent policies have revealed the fluff in our economy and the
                    superfluous capital that recessions correct, IF PERMITTED. We have had two major recessions now in this
                    highly lauded 21<sup>st</sup>-century economy. Which brings us to another revelation. The talking heads, the State and
                    the media, erroneously refer to the market as the economy in the context of opening and closing businesses,
                    schools, and organizations. The obfuscation begins to clear up by analyzing the language. A state cannot open
                    or close an economy. It can help or hurt an economy which has been the battle between conservatives and
                    liberals since the United States was founded. The more accurate term, which pundits avoid, that describes the
                    mandates is market, or free market. Yes, there are other organizations like educational institutions which have
                    been closed, but officials and the mainstream media do not use harsh language like “we had to shut down the
                    free market,” because without a free market you cannot have a free society.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The belligerents in this recession appear to be Democratically-controlled states who have irresponsibly run
                    with deficit budgets for decades and the Federal Government who, in conjunction with the Federal Reserve,
                    can print money on demand. These practices are respectively known as liberal fiscal policy, at the state level, and liberal monetary policy at the federal level. If the Feds decide to bailout the states with no stipulations on
                    budgetary constraints, then what we are witnessing is modern liberalism represented on both sides with
                    taxpayers—current and future—footing the bill, not only by way of money but by way of time, freedom, and
                    property. This is not what Americans are accustomed to hearing. We are accustomed to hearing that
                    Republicans are conservative, and Democrats are liberal. This may be true with social issues, but
                    “inflationeering”—liberal monetary and fiscal policy—has been leveraged by both parties in this century.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To help us understand this conflict even further, it appears that the collective is actually an antagonist to “We
                    the People.” In a classical sense, people and their individual liberty represented liberalism. In the modern
                    sense, liberalism is more related to collectively-controlled mechanisms, collective capital and collective
                    bargaining. In this context the people who have not found a musical chair succumb to the vise of collectivism
                    (modern liberalism). Ironically, modern liberals and their public relations machine vehemently criticize classical
                    liberals (individuals) who do not wear masks and who also want the free market and their small businesses to
                    open so they can pay tribute to the modern liberal machine. This condition is more apparent in blue states that
                    rely heavily on deficit spending and have blitzed us with public relation campaigns. Writing from the beautiful
                    state of New Jersey, and it is a beautiful state, represents the quintessential case of collective capital from New
                    York with collective bargaining from Trenton. A friend in Indiana, a red state running at a surplus, tells me that
                    people in his state do not want a federal bailout nor need one. Another argument for the passage of balanced
                    budget legislation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ironically, I was a proponent of states’ rights in the plight against federal overreach that started after the Civil
                    War, and still am. However, if states operate irresponsibly, it is apparent that they cede their rights to the Fed.
                    COVID-19 has revealed many aspects about the lifestyle of 21<sup>st</sup>-century Americans and the economy. Maybe
                    it’s time to obey the force that is compelling us to cut back on the overdone commercial chaos and modern
                    liberalism.

            <p>
                As mentioned in the promotions for The Art of Political Finance Part I and II, the artists of the 19<sup>th</sup>-century had a
                    sharp eye for the conditions of the period. Below is an illustration which appears to be signed by William Rogers
                    of Harper’s Weekly. It depicts
                    the condition of an employee
                    who worked at the Pullman
                    Palace Car Company and lived
                    in the town of Pullman,
                    Illinois, both owned by George
                    Pullman. The image is the
                    progenitor of two other
                    illustrations I took the liberty
                    of modifying to show the
                    different stages of a command
                    economy. There are fine lines
                    between capitalism, socialism,
                    and free market. Some of the
                    characteristics of each are
                    shown on the plates of the
                    economic vises.
                </p>
            <p>
                The second image, shown
                below, was modified to reflect
                the pressure that railroad
                owners, also known
                euphemistically as “managers,” like JP Morgan and Jay Gould had on farmers due to the high prices of
                transportation resulting from cartelization. In the late 19th century railroads became so prolific, partly due to the
                hard work and productivity of Americans, that the cost of a rail ticket was declining based on the NATURAL
                LAW of price = supply + demand. Railroad owners didn’t accept this law, so they entered into agreements to
                consolidate roads and set prices. This of course was business as usual for industrial capitalists who made their
                own rules. Rather than create legislation that prohibited these agreements and trusts, most government officials
                participated via subsidizing these roads. This stance was in direct opposition to the laissez-faire approach to
                which many of us were indoctrinated. Officials clearly sided with the consolidated capital donor class through
                the labor disputes of the 19th century.

                So far, the free-market system
                seems to bring the most
                fairness to the masses over any
                other economic system that
                has been defined by economic
                pundits of the modern era and
                imposed by bureaucrats.
                Having not studied any one
                economist in depth, we can get
                an idea from a few of the
                better-known economists at
                the cursory level: Adam
                Smith, Karl Marx, Ludwig von
                Mises, John Kenneth
                Galbraith, Milton Friedman,
                John Maynard Keynes, and
                others. They all have one thing
                in common, they are all
                theorists who spend their time
                in the laboratory. Marx and others did infuse practicality, but the socialism that emerged was far from ideal or practical. The lab is not
                necessarily a bad thing, but as a teacher if you don’t take feedback from your practitioners or those outside of
                the laboratory you may fall victim to hubris.
                </p>
            <p>This brings me to a real example regarding the invention of the chronometer, the Royal Society, and a man
            named John Harrison. John Harrison was a self-educated English carpenter and clockmaker who invented the
            marine chronometer. In an attempt to eliminate or reduce losses at sea due to navigational errors, the Royal
            Society had officially invited proposals to solve the problem of calculating longitude while at sea. Harrison's
            solution revolutionized navigation and greatly increased the safety of long-distance sea travel. However, since
            he was a commoner, or someone not affiliated with the Royal Society or the Universities, he had difficulty getting
            full recognition and remunerated for his invention, which was part of the promise and incentive made by the
Royal Society.</p>
            <p>
                This leads us to the dialectic of economists. Was there ever a free market? Let’s assume for argument’s sake that
                Adam Smith was a proponent of the free market (the thesis) and Karl Marx was a proponent of socialism (the
                antithesis). Since the free market did not reign in monopoly, calls for fairness, true free markets, and socialism
                grew. The graphic of the dialectic may look something like this today:
                </p>
            <img className={"d-block mx-auto"} src="/images/articles/vise3.png" />
            <p>
                As you can see from figure 3 above, part of the pressure from the vise that humanity feels today is due to the central command applied by both plates of thesis and antithesis as shown in the resulting vise below.

                Centrally controlled
                economies were not a
                characteristic of a free
                society. This was a
                characteristic of a
                command economy
                    associated with the 20<sup>th</sup>-century Soviet Union
                    and its unilateral
                    Communist Party. As
                    the bipartisan system
                    seems to apply equal
                    pressure, what does it
                    say about the current
                    condition in the United
                    States of America? This
                    brings to mind a quote
                    from one of our less poular presidents.

                What we are experiencing is a seasonal existential
                event...relative to our time and the money dimension.
                The Coronavirus pandemic, whether man made or
                natural, has revealed the false dichotomy. The leaders in
                many countries want to get back to “business as usual”
                pitting the risk of infection and death against economic
                “disaster.” This conflict has shed new light on the lauded
                quote by James Carville: “It’s the economy stupid.” Is it?
                Is that what Americans want and believe to be the acme
                of freedom and liberty? Let’s look at the term economy.
                In simple terms it’s derived from, “how’s your house?”
                Before we answer that we have to answer, “what is our
                house?” Is the United States of America a democracy, as
                popularly touted from the public school system to the
                mainstream news media, is it a republic as once
                established, is it a commercial corporation, the extension
                of which mirrors the British or Dutch East Indies
                companies, run solely for profit where the shareholders
                are made whole or bailed out every time it goes belly up,
                or is it either a de facto or de jure empire or colony thereof
                under the guise of all of the above?
            </p>
            <p>
                If we are an empire and the population has ceded to that
                fact with bromides like “well you have to pay the
                mortgage,” then who is the King or Queen? Is he or she
                the debt holder, aka the bondholder, of a debt that was
                contrived from fiat? Have you ever wondered why the
                United States of America, billed as the most productive and free country in the history of mankind has
                accumulated a $22 trillion debt and rising? The Federal Reserve wants to play the white knight and infuse more
                money into the system to provide the ability for Americans to eat, pay their taxes, pay their rents and mortgages
                and “go back to business as usual.” Can you guess what’s on the other side of that money? If you said “debt,”
                you can clearly see why the Federal Reserve wants the song to remain the same.
                </p>
            <p>
                We all want relief. More money – printed money with a debt-basis – does not provide relief. For all you mothers
                out there, do you want your children to be saddled with more debt? This is the formula that’s been implemented
                by the oligarchs for over 150 years, before the Federal Reserve. It’s not an American precept. It’s not a Godly
                precept. Even Alexander Hamilton said, “a national debt, IF NOT EXCESSIVE, will be to us a national blessing.
                In perspective, this quote was made at the beginning of a country which needed credit. It only took 50 years to
                pay the debt off, proven by Andrew Jackson. After 250 years, The United States of America, moreover its citizens,
                has proven that hard work and enterprise “trump” most challenges that have been posed to humanity. So why
                the debt?

                For three years we have heard calls for the impeachment of President Trump for any number of alleged infractions; Russian collusion, bribing porn stars, or just being an embarrassment to America. If we measure the present against history, a practice we should all become accustomed to, we should look at of those same calls pointed at other presidents. In the graphic to the left by the famous Harper’s Weekly, a publication with a Republican slant, the 1866 cartoon by Thomas Nast identifies Democratic President Andrew Johnson as King Andy I. In 1833 another cartoonist gave the same moniker to Andrew Jackson, an even stronger-willed Democratic President.</p>
            <p>
                According to David O. Stewart, author of, “Impeached: The Trial of Andrew Johnson and the Fight for Lincoln’s Legacy,” Johnson was an official with a good resume but wasn’t necessarily one you could warm up to. He wasn’t known for using humor like his witty predecessor. Even fellow Democrat, James Polk once described him as vindictive and perverse.</p>
            <p>
                In 1866, with the social climate changing, things were tense in the South. Johnson was noted for saying that the country’s greatest risk was that enfranchised blacks were going to “Africanize the South.” In addition to these cultural and racial differences, Johnson exercised vetoes of the Civil Rights Act and Reconstruction laws that Congress overrode, but blacks, white sympathizers (“scalawags”) and military personnel were still at risk. Other political confrontations came from the Republicans who were considered “radical.” They didn’t want the Democrats – who, with all of their misgivings, were the conservatives of the period – to re-establish dominance or participation in government. During the war and shortly after the Republicans passed a raft of radical monetary policy ex parte in order to maintain the superiority of the banks and the bondholders - many of them foreign. In doing so they proclaimed the sanctity of the “credit of the United States.” With Johnson in the presidency, the battle of supremacy between Congress and the executive crept up again; a similar battle that Jackson had forty years prior with the Second Bank of the United States and Congress.</p>
            <p>
                Stewart cites the main battle that led to Johnson’s impeachment was between Johnson and Secretary of War, Edwin Stanton who usurped Johnson’s authority when it came to military execution of the Reconstruction laws. In turn, Johnson wanted to replace Stanton. Since the Constitution wasn’t explicit about cabinet dismissals, the
                        Republican Congress conveniently created the Tenure of Office Act that required Congress to approve the president’s cabinet members and such firings. Regardless, Johnson appointed Lorenzo Thomas to the post in which Stanton and Thomas bickered back and forth as to who was the actual Secretary. While Thomas attended cabinet meetings, Stanton occupied the War Department offices for three months. In anticipation of staying longer, Stanton sent a sergeant to his home for food clothes and bed linens. Mrs. Stanton refused the request and nstructed the sergeant to tell her husband to resign immediately and come straight home.</p>
            <p>
                Johnson, who was eventually impeached, somehow survived by getting seven of the 19 votes needed for acquittal from the adversarial party. Stewart cites five reasons Johnson was able to get the seven votes. Among them were, dislike for Johnson’s would be successor, patience on the side of Republicans who knew Grant was soon to be the next president in 1868, and of course something else that’s not discussed in polite society, patronage and cash bribes.<sup>i</sup></p>
            <p>
                The reconcilable challenges to 21<sup>st</sup>-century partisans bearing this history are, for Republicans, acknowledging that their party was once the radical or liberal party that espoused early globalism through monetary and fiscal policy, and for Democrats, that their party leaned toward white supremacy but held to fiscal conservatism. Both Kings, both Andrews, both Democrats, both conservatives, went head to head with the bank party and Congress. Both were criticized and demonized by the liberal press. There was one other famous impeachment hearing of a Democratic president (Bill Clinton) but that’s another story entirely. President Trump appears to be experiencing the same in his fight with Congress and the “swamp.” As Americans, we have to ask if Congress is truly representative of the “people.” Many Americans don’t seem to think so, unless our definition of “people” is inaccurate. In attempting to stop this spin – what we do here at NJRedpill.com – we have to ask ourselves, if Congress is still the bank party – supporting Wall Street, the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, etc., - regardless of nominal designations, do we want President Trump impeached? Or is it all what Bigdawg calls, “Kabuki Theater?”</p></>

                <em>
                    And when we were all fallen to the earth, I
                    heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying
                    in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why
                    persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick

            <p className="clearRight">
                For those of you who are not familiar
                with the story, an ox goad was a stick
                with a pointed piece of iron on its tip
                used to prod the oxen when plowing. The
                farmer would prick the animal to steer it
                in the right direction. Sometimes the
                animal would rebel by kicking out at the
                prick, and this would result in the prick
                being driven even further into its flesh.
                The following story has a similar lesson.
                Unfortunately, the pricks were not of the
                farmer.
                </p>
            <p>
                Recorded in “Wealth of Nations,” Adam
                Smith claimed to be a witness of one of
                the simplest examples of the successful
                divisions of labor. A pin factory
                discovered the exponential increase in
                productivity when the manufacturing of
                a pin was broken down into 18 separate
                tasks. “One man draws out the wire,
                another straights it, a third cuts it, a fourth points it,”etc., and by dividing the labor, twenty men with specialized
                skills could make an astonishing forty-eight thousand pins in a day. When those 18 operations were performed
                by one man, Smith claimed that nary a pin was made in a day. Smith also pointed out that the multiplication
                afforded by this division of labor worked better in manufacturing than agriculture. So if your primary goal is
                monetary gain, do you enter the arena of agriculture or manufacturing? This was the primary motivation that
                transformed our country from agriculture to industry, which in itself is not necessarily contemptible. But what
                happens when markets are saturated?
                </p>
            <p>
                Looking at the example that Smith provides, a pin factory on the island of Great Britain that produced 48,000
                pins a day would quickly run out of customers regardless of price – price decreasing with more production and
                less demand. As Jeff Madrick points out in his article entitled, “How the Invisible Hand Was Corrupted by
                Laissez-Faire Economics,” the size of the market was every bit as critical as output—and maybe more so—and
                has usually been overlooked by contemporary economists. The division of labor and other productivity
                improvements could only be made if the market was large enough. What good would it be to make forty-eight
                thousand pins rather than two hundred if there was no need for those pins? And so, markets had to expand
                    beyond the village, the region, the nation, and the world. <sup>i</sup>
            </p>
            <p>
                The next question became, “how does a merchant expand his market?” Naturally he would either travel to
                foreign lands to sell his pins or hire someone to do it. As he has to supervise his operation, he appropriately
                hires someone. So, the salesman travels to the foreign land. But in doing so he is met with resistance and turned
                away with no opportunity to sell. Upon his return and report to the factory owner, the proprietor is outraged.
                Faced with this challenge and the will to survive (the self-interest that Smith posited was the marrow of wealth)
                he turns to his government and relates the problem. The government, having an interest in the revenues from
                the manufacture of pins is motivated to become involved at the behest of the manufacturer. At this, Great Britain
                deploys ships of the finest Navy ever assembled. The ships either bombard the land to secure access for the
                salesman or secure it by mere presence and intimidation. The salesman proceeds to the local markets and finds
                that the people in the foreign land do not want the pins or have no need for them. Upon his return to the factory,
                the owner is perplexed by “these stupid, parochial, provincial, simple, uneducated, uncivilized, and backward
                people. They don’t realize how these pins can help their lives.”
                </p>
            <p>
                Once the battleships provided security for the pin merchant, the real bombardment ensued. The bombardment
                of bromides, not only by salesmen in the markets but by sermons, presses, speeches by government officials,
                and eventually institutions of higher learning (universities). And as an entire culture was captivated, in the end
                it was a very visible hand that guided the market, followed by promises and platitudes of the factory owner.
                With the cultural change came new customers, new workers, and a new “civilization.”
                </p>
            <p>
                But the factory owner and the governments were not satisfied. The factory owner found it too costly to
                manufacture the pins in Great Britain and ship them to the new land. With the same military might from the
                motherland, the factory owner acquired property in his new territory and built a factory. As all the arable land
                was exhausted, the inhabitants had no way of sustaining themselves lest they work in the factory for wages. The
                land, which provided a year’s worth of sustenance in only eight months of toil or less, was exchanged for twelve
                months of toil and the permission to sustain oneself on day to day basis, as long as one showed up for work,
                stayed in line, and made his quota.
