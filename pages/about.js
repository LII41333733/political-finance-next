In addition to the lesson plans, some of the tools will include timelines, calculators, planning models, and other items that will help facilitate that orientation.</p>

There are over 150 illustrations from the period, mostly, Currier & Ives, Harper's Weekly, Frank Leslieâ€™s Illustrated, Puck, and others, along with summaries.  They provide some of the basis for the topics, and an entertaining perspective on the subject.  If a picture is truly worth a thousand words, then these illustrations provide the equivalent of 150,000 pages of text, but with the advantage of graphic facilitation.</p>

In addition, 90 percent of information transmitted to the brain is visual, and visuals are processed 60,000 times faster in the brain than text. This indicates visual education aids like video can improve learning styles and increase the rate at which we retain information.</p>
