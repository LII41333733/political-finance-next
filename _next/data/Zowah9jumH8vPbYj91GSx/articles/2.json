A pin factory discovered the exponential increase in productivity when the manufacturing of a pin was broken down into 18 separate tasks. “One man draws out the wire, another straights it, a third cuts it, a fourth points it,”etc., and by dividing the labor, twenty men with specialized skills could make an astonishing forty-eight thousand pins in a day. When those 18 operations were performed by one man, Smith claimed that nary a pin was made in a day. Smith also pointed out that the multiplication afforded by this division of labor worked better in manufacturing than agriculture. So if your primary goal is monetary gain, do you enter the arena of agriculture or manufacturing? This was the primary motivation that transformed our country from agriculture to industry, which in itself is not necessarily contemptible.

The division of labor and other productivity improvements could only be made if the market was large enough.

But in doing so he is met with resistance and turned away with no opportunity to sell. Upon his return and report to the factory owner, the proprietor is outraged. Faced with this challenge and the will to survive (the self-interest that Smith posited was the marrow of wealth) he turns to his government and relates the problem. The government, having an interest in the revenues from the manufacture of pins is motivated to become involved at the behest of the manufacturer. At this, Great Britain deploys ships of the finest Navy ever assembled. The ships either bombard the land to secure access for the salesman or secure it by mere presence and intimidation. The salesman proceeds to the local markets and finds that the people in the foreign land do not want the pins or have no need for them.

Other political confrontations came from the Republicans who were considered “radical.” They didn’t want the Democrats – who, with all of their misgivings, were the conservatives of the period – to re-establish dominance or participation in government. During the war and shortly after the Republicans passed a raft of radical monetary policy ex parte in order to maintain the superiority of the banks and the bondholders - many of them foreign.

Regardless, Johnson appointed Lorenzo Thomas to the post in which Stanton and Thomas bickered back and forth as to who was the actual Secretary.

The obfuscation begins to clear up by analyzing the language. A state cannot open or close an economy. It can help or hurt an economy which has been the battle between conservatives and liberals since the United States was founded. The more accurate term, which pundits avoid, that describes the mandates is market, or free market.

The Division of Taxation can order a municipality to perform a revaluation. The goal is statewide uniformity every ten years, which, in this taxpayer’s opinion, is a little bit rapid, but reflects the government’s propensity to leverage inflation and therefore use predatory taxation methods.  The revaluation process measures the disparity between assessed value and ‘true value.’ A ratio of 85 percent or lower generally denotes noncompliance, which makes the timing of these revaluations relevant. That stipulation dictates unilateral revaluations, which are induced by spikes in the market. Here are a few examples. In 2005 Boonton, NJ had planned for a revaluation after acknowledging that there was a real estate market “boom.” In 2007, at the height of the real-estate bubble, Robbinsville, NJ performed a revaluation but provided for a 15% tolerance in assessments as conceded by the assessor’s office, “since all appraisals/assessments are an opinion of value.” That same year the property which I owned went from an assessed value of $111,600 to $222,300; essentially doubling.
